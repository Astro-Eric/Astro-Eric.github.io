I am Haozhe Jiang, a senior student from Yao Class, Tsinghua University. I have a broad interest in Machine Learning. I am also enthusiastic about Physics. My research works mainly focus on building efficient decision-making agents, including reinforcement learning, multi-agent system etc. I also work on applying machine learning to other fields such as cryptography and astronomy.

Please feel free to contact me.

Biography
======

I was born and raised in the wonderful city of Shanghai. My childhood dream was to become an astronomer and it triggered my interest in Science when I was still a little boy. Before college, I was at the No.2 High School of East China Normal University. Back then, I took part in Physics Competition and I was deeply impressed by the beauty of Physics. In my freshman and sophomore year I worked primarily with Professor [Chongjie Zhang](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html) on empirical Reinforcement Learning. Later I worked closely with Professor [Simon Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com) and Professor [Maryam Fazel](https://people.ece.uw.edu/fazel_maryam/) on learning problems in Game Theory.

Miscellaneous
======

My favorite sport is Basketball. I usually play as a shooting guard.

I love classical music. My favorite piece is Op.53 by Frédéric Chopin, Polonaise in A Flat. My favorite composer is Ludwig van Beethoven.

Photographying is one of my hobbies. I am particularly fond of shooting natural views. Check out some [here](https://astro-eric.github.io/photos/).
